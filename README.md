# fQuery - jQuery for Fable

<p>
	I love F#, and I use it in all my personal apps, at least on the server side. I've never used Fable for the client though,
	because of external Javascript dependencies that would be too painful to write bindings for. The common denominator, both in my personal life
	and in the enterprise, is jQuery.
</p>

<p>
	fQuery is a clone of jQuery, written in and for F# client-side apps using Fable.
